# June 4th: Research + Schematic Design
Although I had the general gist of what I wanted to create, I needed to decide on specifics and the parts I wanted.  
Opted to use a XIAO RP2040 as I had previously used it for hackpad. Other options like a raspberry pico didn't seem to provide any major improvements.  
From there, I decided to use ScottoKeebs placeholder switches and diodes, while setting up the schematic.  
Did some research on the USB aspect of the project, and it appears I will need another MCU for that.  

Total time spent: 1:30
